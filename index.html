            <h2>Phase 1</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               Phase 1 is the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It consists of 6 films starting with the
               original Iron Man and ending with The Avengers. The goal in this phase was to establish the core member
               of the Avengers through origin stories before bringing them all together in the first Marvel crossover
               event in a live action film. It also establishes Thanos as the main overarching threat of the franchise.

                  <h3>Phase 2</h3>
                  <p id="blueParagraph">
                     Phase 2 follow phase 1 of the MCU by starting to experiment more. Where as phase 1 was risky in
                     trying to
                     start an entire comic book movie universe for the first time, phase 2 tests how much audiences will
                     invest in the more obscure elements. Each sequel film to the original characters has a new director
                     bringing a new style to them. Winter Soldier being by far the most successful with that film being
                     often
                     regarded as one of Marvels best. It took Captain America in a more gritty direction that
                     deconstructs his
                     typical boy scout attitude. But the real test during this phase was adding the Guardians of the
                     Galaxy
                     and Ant-Man. Both films came out to resounding success, giving Marvel the go ahead on being willing
                     to
                     try any property under their belt going forward.

                  <h4>Phase 3</h4>
                  <p id="purpleParagraph">
                     Phase 3 of the MCU is about the final buildup and conclusion of the 	&quot;Infinity Saga	&quot;. This phase
                     sets any remaining pieces or characters in place to service the plot of the final two Avengers
                     films. It introduces new heroes like Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel and Black Panther.
                     Phase 3 also starts with Captain America Civil War, a film that splits the Avengers aparts which
                     greatly affects the plot of Infinity War before uniting the Avengers again in Endgame. Endgame
                     wrapped up the Infinity Saga while planting a few seeds for the future of the MCU as well.

                  <h5>Phase 4</h5>
                  <p id="orangeParagraph">
                     Phase 4 of the MCU starts a new saga. This saga would be revealed to be called the Multiverse Saga.
                     Much of Phase 4 is a combination of multiversal projects as well as projects about grief. This
                     phase marked the first time the MCU was expanded into Disney+ series. Now the franchise is watched
                     on big and small screens. The first project, Wandavision, is a shining example of everything new in
                     this phase. Its a show that dabbles loosely into the multiverse while delving into Scarlet Witch'ss
                     grief after the events of Avengers Infinity War. It also happens to be the first Disney+ show. This
                     phase of the MCU also introduced the franchises next big bad guy, Kang the Conqueror.

                     Phase 5 of the MCU is ongoing and still in its infancy. Where this phase is taking the franchise is
                     still yet to be completely determined.
